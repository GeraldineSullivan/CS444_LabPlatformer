I already added a tween to the heart collectables before I saw final lab.
It does similar to what was suggested on the document.

I have instead added a dust trail to the Dash ability. Press D to dash
I've also added particles to the Volcano in Level 4, so that it looks fun

TO DO:
I didn't have time to get a proper "end game" screen working. 
So for now it's a label that says GAME OVER, with a delay before game quits
